# cleanup Makefile
- code is ugly fix it
- web ui code is ugly clean it up

# need to make new UI
- use colors for statuses (red if it happened now, blue if it's stale)
- gradually change the color as time passes (use TEMP_COLORS)
- add solar anim, when on, next to temp (like check/warn)

# find in files:
// TODO: request_send_quick can fail --> print/handle that
