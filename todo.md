# heat clock
- add gas to clock or nah?

# code cleanup:
- make all .js files like time-picker.js (only register functions used outside of scope with window.nameOfFunc = function() { ...)
- do more grouping in structs (BasInfo), we can group stuff up

# would be nice / debug
- add endpoint to get /values (need an endpoint like /c to see current values)

# DON'T CARE:
// TODO: request_send_quick can fail --> print/handle that
