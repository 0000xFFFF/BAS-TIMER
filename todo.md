# top:
- do more grouping in structs (BasInfo), we can group stuff up
- add endpoint to get /values (need an endpoint like /c to see current values)
- ? for unint values
- min max temp from wttr.in --- BRUH ... i can get min/max temp but I can't get other values in j1 j2 formats

# find in files:
// TODO: request_send_quick can fail --> print/handle that

# not important:
